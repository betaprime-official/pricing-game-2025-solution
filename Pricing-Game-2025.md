# Pricing Game 2025

## Context

In this edition of the Pricing Game, you are the actuary of an insurance company competing in a motor Third-Party Liability insurance market.

- All participating teams make up 100% of the market share, and each is randomly assigned a portfolio of customers.
- The market overall is unprofitable, with a loss ratio above 100%.
- Existing policyholders first receive a renewal premium offer from their current insurer. If they decline, they get quotes from every company.
- There are minimum regulatory prices in place to avoid insolvencies  

Game structure:

1. Technical Pricing - Derive a technical rating structure based on GLMs to improve profitability.
2. Renewal Pricing – Refine the technical rating structure based on renewal premium increases to retain insureds.
3. New Business – Quote insureds that leave other companies to gain market share while mantaining profitable business.

### Rating Structure (`rating_structure.json`)

#### Structure Format
```json
{
  "base_values": {
    "value": 525.03
  },
  "relativities": {
    "driver_age": {
      "18-25": 1.2500,
      "26-35": 1.0000,
      "36-50": 0.9500,
      "51-inf": 0.8500
    },
    "province": {
      "RI": 1.0000,
      "NJ": 1.1200,
      "SH": 0.9800
    }
  },
  "base_group": "driver_age: 26-35, province: RI, ..."
}
```

#### Premium Calculation Examples

**Example 1: Base Group**
- Driver age: 28 years (26-35 group) → Relativity: 1.0000
- Province: RI → Relativity: 1.0000
- **Premium Calculation**: $525.03 × 1.0000 × 1.0000 = **$525.03**

**Example 2: High-Risk Profile**
- Driver age: 22 years (18-25 group) → Relativity: 1.2500  
- Province: NJ → Relativity: 1.1200
- **Premium Calculation**: $525.03 × 1.2500 × 1.1200 = **$735.04**

## Submission Guidelines

- Team 'x' is required to submit a single rating structure file (`player_x.json`), which is generated by the `workflow.qmd`. This file will be used to price both renewal and new policies.
